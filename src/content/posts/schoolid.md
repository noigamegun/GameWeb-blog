So I was wondering if the school id can somehow be "hacked" and also RFID in general, and that made me fall into the rabbit hole of RFID stuff.
I guess that 1 more thing to ~~waste~~ spend money on instead of maimai :3

Most of the stuff I found is from the Chameleon Ultra ("CU from now") but I'll format the commands to be pm3 commands since it seems more used.

So what is the chip inside this thing anyways?

So it's a Fudan's MIFARE Classic 1K. I kinda expect a Fudan here since NXP ICs isn't common. And since this is a IC that's cracked since 2008, it's not that hard to copy this thing. We still don't know the keys tho. So I ran `hf mf autopwn`

Took less than 5 seconds to crack the keys. The only sector that have the key changed here is sector 6. What is in there?

So on block 26 (Y) there `AAAAA|BBBBB` in hex. A being the student ID for that card and B is a 5 digit "passcode". The passcode is to probably identify a suspended card.

Pretty much this thing is cracked already and ready to be copied. So I tried copying it to other tags and testing if it work. And this is what I tested as of writing this.

- Gen 1a Magic Card = Not enough testing but seems to not work sometimes.
- CUID/Gen 2 Magic Card = Works perfectly.
- CU Emulation = Works with some error but mostly perfect.

So... If ya don't want to pay 100 THB for a new card, just back up your card :p
You dont even need the hardware. Just a Android phone with "Mifare Classic Tool" and a magic tag is enough. I've already mentioned the keys here. ( Not on iOS tho :) )
But like if your card is indeed lost and you disabled the card, your copied card would be disabled too :(

Anyways we just have to see if ACT with change the card to something a Desfire or something. (Also the 100 THB would also go up if they changed it since MFC 1K is around 10 THB per card while a Desfire is like 50 THB ;-; )

Anyways I'm out
